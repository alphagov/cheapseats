## Installing ##

Ensure you follow the [nodegit](https://github.com/nodegit/nodegit) install instructions.

For everything else ```npm install``` will suffice.

## Running ##

```npm start```

you can also configure it with command line args for example

```node index.js --reporter nyan```


## Problem? ##

### It wont install ###

It's probably nodegit read the install instructions [here](https://github.com/nodegit/nodegit)

It says ```Error: connect ECONNREFUSED```? Are you running selenium or phantom? Is the port correct?

### But I want it to check out a specific version of spotlight? ###

This is coming but it's not written yet...
